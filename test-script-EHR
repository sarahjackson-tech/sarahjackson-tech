### **Test Case 3: Lab Test Request**

#### **Objective**: Ensure that a lab test can be successfully requested for a patient.

1. **Steps**:
   1. Log into the EMR system and search for the patient by Patient ID.
   2. Navigate to the **Orders** section in the patient chart.
   3. Click on **New Lab Order**.
   4. Select the required test (e.g., CBC, Blood Glucose, Urinalysis).
   5. Specify the priority (e.g., STAT, Routine).
   6. Submit the lab order for processing.

2. **Expected Results**:
   - The lab test request should be successfully submitted and appear in the lab order queue.
   - The order should show up in the patient's order history.
   - No validation errors should appear.

3. **Actual Results**:  
   - [To be filled during testing]

4. **Status**: [Pass/Fail]

5. **Notes/Issues**:  
   - [To be filled during testing]

### **Test Case 4: Patient Discharge**

#### **Objective**: Validate that a patient can be successfully discharged from the hospital.

1. **Steps**:
   1. Log into the EMR system and search for the admitted patient.
   2. Navigate to the **Discharge** module.
   3. Confirm that all discharge orders (e.g., medications, follow-up tests) are complete.
   4. Select the discharge date and reason.
   5. Click **Submit** to discharge the patient.

2. **Expected Results**:
   - The patient’s status should update to **Discharged**.
   - The patient should no longer appear in the **Admitted Patients** list.
   - The discharge summary should be generated and stored in the patient’s chart.

3. **Actual Results**:  
   - [To be filled during testing]

4. **Status**: [Pass/Fail]

5. **Notes/Issues**:  
   - [To be filled during testing]

### **Test Case 5: Viewing Patient History**

#### **Objective**: Verify that the patient’s medical history can be accessed after discharge.

1. **Steps**:
   1. Log into the EMR system.
   2. Search for a discharged patient by their Patient ID.
   3. Navigate to the **Patient History** section.
   4. Review the past medical history, medication history, and lab results.

2. **Expected Results**:
   - The system should display the patient’s full medical history.
   - The data should be accurate and complete without any missing information.
